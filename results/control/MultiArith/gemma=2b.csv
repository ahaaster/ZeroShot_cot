" A pet shelter had 9 puppies when another 12 were brought in. If 3 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted? ","To calculate the time it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we can use the concept of **cumulative rate of change.**

Initially, there are 9 puppies. The shelter takes in 12 puppies, bringing the total to 21 puppies.

If 3 puppies are adopted each day, the number of puppies remaining is:

21 - 3 = 18

Therefore, the number of puppies adopted in the following day is 3.

After this day, there are 15 puppies. The number of puppies adopted in the subsequent days can be calculated using the same formula:

15 - 3 = 12
12 - 3 = 9
9 - 3 = 6

Continuing this pattern, we can see that the number of puppies adopted in each day is decreasing by 3.

Therefore, it would take **12 days** for all 9 puppies to be adopted.",7
