" Paige had 43 math problems and 12 science problems for homework. If she finished 44 of the problems at school, how many problems did she have to do for homework? ","To find out how many problems Paige had left to do for homework, we need to subtract the number of problems she completed from the total number of math and science problems.

She started with 43 math problems and finished 44 at school. To find out how many she has left, we can subtract:

43 (math) - 44 (completed) = -1

This means Paige actually completed one more problem than she had for homework. Since there are no negative numbers in this context, it's likely that the question meant to ask how many problems she finished at school and then subtracted those from her total homework problems.

" Edward started his own lawn mowing business. In the spring he made 2 dollars mowing lawns and in the summer he made 27 dollars. If he had to spend 5 dollars buying supplies, how much money did he end up with? ","To find out how much money Edward ended up with, we need to subtract the cost of supplies from his total earnings.

Edward's spring mowing business: $2 per lawn
Number of lawns mowed in the spring: Not given, but let's call it x
Total earnings in the spring: 2x

Edward's summer mowing business: $27 per lawn
Number of lawns mowed in the summer: 27
Total earnings in the summer: 27 * 27 = 729

Now, we can set up an equation to represent Edward's total earnings:
2x + 27(27) = Total earnings
2x + 729 = ?

To find out how much money Edward ended up with, we need to subtract the cost of supplies from his total earnings.
Cost of supplies: $5

So, let's calculate his total earnings first:
2x + 729 = ?
We know that x is not given, but we can express it in terms of a variable. Let's call it y.

2y + 729 = ?

Now, we need to find the value of y (or x). Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to do so directly. However, we can try to solve for y using another equation.

We know that Edward spent $5 on supplies:
Cost of supplies: $5
Number of lawns mowed: Not given

Let's call the number of lawns mowed in the spring ""x"". Then, his total earnings would be 2x + 27(27) = Total earnings.
Since he spent $5 on supplies, we can set up another equation:
2x + 729 - 5 = Total earnings
2x + 724 = ?

Now, we have two equations with two variables (y and x). We can solve for y by substituting the expression for x from the first equation into the second equation.

Substituting 2y + 729 = ?
We know that 2y + 729 - 5 = Total earnings
2y + 724 = ?

Now, we have two equations with one variable (y):
2y + 724 = ?
2y + 729 - 5 = ?

Let's simplify the second equation:
2y + 724 = ?
2y + 724 - 5 = ?

Combine like terms:
2y + 719 = ?

Subtract 719 from both sides:
2y = -719

Divide by 2:
y = -719/2
y = -359.5",24

" A pet shelter had 3 puppies when another 3 were brought in. If 3 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted? ","To find out how long it will take for the puppies to be adopted, we need to divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day.

The shelter initially had 3 puppies. Another 3 were brought in, making a total of 6 puppies.
The puppies are being adopted at a rate of 3 per day.

To find out how long it will take for all the puppies to be adopted, we can divide the total number of puppies by the number adopted per day:

6 (total puppies) ÷ 3 (puppies adopted per day) = 2 days

So, it will take 2 days for all the puppies to be adopted.",2
" While playing at the arcade, Luke won 2 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 13 tickets playing 'skee ball'. If he was trying to buy candy that cost 3 tickets a piece, how many could he buy? ","Luke won 2 tickets from 'Whack a Mole', which is equivalent to 2 / 3 of a candy piece. He also won 13 tickets from 'Skee Ball', which is equivalent to 13 * 3 = 39 candy pieces.

So, in total, Luke has 2/3 + 39 = 41/3 candy pieces. To convert this into whole numbers, we can divide by 1 and then multiply by 3: 

41 / 3 = 13 with a remainder of 2
13 * 3 = 39

There are 11 people in the group. Since 2 are kids, the number of adults is:

11 (total people) - 2 (kids) = 9 adults

Each adult meal costs $8, so the cost for the adults is:

9 adults * $8 per adult = $72

Since she uses 8 cups of flour on each one and there are 17 brownies, we multiply 8 by 17:

8 * 17 = 136

So Tiffany needs a total of 136 cups of flour for her party. Since she already baked 8 brownies, she still needs to bake 16 more brownies to reach the required amount.

To find out how many cups of flour she will need for these additional 16 brownies, we multiply 8 by 16:

So, they used 9 shelves.",2
" Roger is at the library helping put away books. There are 14 book to put away total but a librarian takes 2 of them and leaves Roger with the rest. If he can fit 3 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need? ","To find out how many shelves Roger needs, we first need to determine how many books he has left after the librarian took some.

There were originally 14 books, but the librarian took 2, so Roger is left with:

14 - 2 = 12 books

Since Roger can fit 3 books on a shelf, we divide the number of remaining books by 3 to find out how many shelves he needs:

12 / 3 = 4

So, Roger will need 4 shelves.",4
 A pet store had 56 puppies. In one day they sold 24 of them and put the rest into cages with 4 in each cage. How many cages did they use? ,"To find out how many cages were used, we need to divide the number of puppies by the number of puppies per cage.
