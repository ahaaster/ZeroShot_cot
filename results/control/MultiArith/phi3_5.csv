" For Halloween Debby and her sister combined the candy they received. Debby had 32 pieces of candy while her sister had 42. If they ate 35 pieces the first night, how many pieces do they have left? ","Debby and her sister together initially had:

32 (Debby's candy) + 42 (her sister' extraneous piece of information as it doesn’t affect their total amount. So we only consider Debby's pieces, which are already given to be the sum they have before eating any. They ate 35 pieces on the first night:

Total candy initially = 32 (Debby) + X (her sister - not needed as it doesn’t change with what we know).
Candy after one night of consumption = Total initial candy - Candy eaten in that night.
                                = 32 pieces - 35 pieces, which would result in a negative number (-3), indicating they didn't have enough to eat for the entirety of those 35 candies on just their first night alone without considering her sister’s contribution beyond Debby’s initial amount.
                                = Not possible as you cannot consume more candy than what is available, which suggests there might be a misunderstanding in how many pieces they had or consumed initially since one can't eat negative candies. 

Assuming the question meant that together (Debby and her sister) have enough to cover those initials:
Total combined = Debby’s candy + Sister’s contribution, which we don’t need as it doesn’t change with what is given for Debby's amount alone. They ate 35 pieces on the first night so they would be left with:
                                = Total initial (Debby) - Candy eaten in that night
                                = 32 pieces - 35 pieces, which again results in an impossible situation of negative candies remaining after consumption.

To resolve this and make sense out of the question as it stands without additional information about her sister's contribution:
If they only had Debby’s candy to begin with (which is a logical assumption since we are not given any amount for her sister), then if 35 pieces were eaten, there would be no candies left. However, this contradicts the fact that together they have more than what was initially mentioned by just one person:
                                = Total initial candy (Debby) - Candy consumed on first night
                                = 32 pieces - 35 pieces is not possible without additional information about her sister's contribution. Therefore, we must assume that the question contains an error or there’s missing context regarding how many candies Debby and/or her sister had initially beyond what was provided for one person (Debbie).
                                = Insufficient data to determine remaining pieces of candy without knowing exactly how much each individual started with. 

To accurately answer this question, we would need clarification on the total amount they both combined before eating any candies or a correction regarding Debby's initial count and her sister’s contribution if it differs from what was provided for just one person (Debbie). If indeed only considering Debby:
                                = 32 pieces - 35 pieces, which is not feasible. They would need at least as many candies to consume the amount they ate on that first night without going into negative numbers of candy remaining. Thus, there seems to be an error in how this question was posed or additional information required for it to make sense and have a logical answer based upon standard arithmetic operations with positive quantities (candies).

If we assume the total amount they had initially is simply Debby's 32 pieces plus her sister’s contribution, which isn't specified but necessary:
                                = Total initial candy - Candy consumed on first night. Without knowing exactly how much each individual started with (Debbie and Sister), we cannot calculate the remaining candies accurately beyond acknowledging that they must have had at least 35 pieces to begin consuming them as stated, which would leave zero after consumption if true amounts were equal or more than what was consumed.
                                = Insufficient data for a precise calculation; question seems flawed without additional information on the sister's contribution beyond Debby’s initial count of 32 pieces and clarification that they had enough to cover those first night candies before consumption, not less as implied by subtracting more than what was initially present.

To resolve this mathematically:
                                = Total candy (Debbie + Sister) - Candy consumed on the first night must be at least 35 pieces for them to have enough; otherwise, they would end up with negative candies which is not possible in reality without going into deficit.",39
 A pet store had 13 siamese cats and 5 house cats. During a sale they sold 10 cats. How many cats do they have left? ,"The pet store originally had a total of 13 Siamese cats + 5 house cats = 18 cats in total. If during the sale, they sold 10 cats, then you subtract those from the original number:

" The school cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 9 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with? ","The total number of apples ordered by the cafeteria is:

If only 9 students want to take an apple, then at most 9 apples can be taken. Assuming each student takes one apple (which would use up all of them), the cafeteria would have:

49 total apples - 9 taken by students = 40 extra apples left over.

So, the cafeteria ends up with 40 extra apples that are not being used for lunches if each student takes only one apple.",40
" Lana picked 36 tulips and 37 roses to make flower bouquets. If she only used 70 of the flowers though, how many extra flowers did Lana pick?

" Carol and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Carol picked 29 and her mother picked 16. If only 38 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have? "," Carol and her mom together picked a total of 29 (Carol's pick) + 16 (mom' extraneous information as it does not contribute to finding out the number of bad carrots. To find the number of good carrots, we simply add Carol's harvest with that of her mother:

Good Carrots = Carol's Pick + Mother's Pick
             = 29 + 16
             = 45

Since only 38 were actually good, the difference between what they picked and how many are good will give us the number of bad carrots:

Bad Carrots = Total Picked - Good Carrots
            = (Carol's Pick + Mother's Pick) - Number of Good Carrots
            = 45 - 38
            = 7

So, they had 7 bad carrots.",7

 A pet store had 12 siamese cats and 20 house cats. During a sale they sold 20 cats. How many cats do they have left? ,"The pet store originally had a total of 12 Siamese cats + 20 house cats = 32 cats. If they sold 20 cats during the sale, then they would be left with:

32 original cats - 20 sold cats = 12 cats remaining.

So, the pet store has 1 extraneous information here because selling all their stock doesn't make sense if there are only 32 to begin with and you can sell up to that number without having any left over afterward (assuming they sold as many as possible). If indeed every single cat was sold during a sale, the pet store would have no cats remaining. However, based on your question's phrasing suggesting there are still some cats left:

32 original cats - 20 sold cats = 12 cats remain unsold and thus unaccounted for in this scenario; these could be additional details not provided or perhaps they were already accounting for the remaining stock before any sales. Without further context, it's difficult to provide a precise answer beyond what has been calculated here:

If all sold (which is unlikely with only 20 cats), then there would be no unsold/remaining cats left in inventory at that pet store after the sale; however, if not every single cat was sold and some are still present before any further sales or events occur, they could have up to a maximum of:

32 original total - 18 (or fewer) potentially remaining unsold = between zero cats left over until all possible ones were accounted for in the sale. The exact number would depend on how many sold during that specific event which isn't specified beyond ""during a sale they sold some."" If we assume exactly half, then:
32 - (1/2 of 32) = 32 / 2 = 16 cats remaining after the hypothetical scenario where only half were sold. But without specific details on how many actually got sold during that particular sale event in your question's context, we can’t determine an exact number beyond this general calculation methodology.

If you have additional information or if there was a misunderstanding of what happened with the cats after they went for their ""during"" sales period mentioned: please provide further details so I may give more accurate guidance!",12

" Megan was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 7 books on it. If she had 8 shelves of mystery books and 2 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total? "," To find the total number of books Megan has, we need to multiply the number of books per shelf by the number of shelves for each type of book.

For mystery books:
8 shelves * 7 books per shelf = 56 books

For picture books:
2 shelves * 7 books per shelf = 14 books

Now, we add the two totals together to find the overall total number of books:
56 mystery books + 14 picture books = 70 books

So, Megan has a total of 7dictory and bookshelves. Let'seach shelf contain exactly seven items—a consistent pattern that suggests an organized approach towards her collection management. Given this information, we can calculate the overall count by considering both mystery novels (which she seems to have amassed in eight distinct sections) and picture books housed on two separate bookcases or designated areas within a larger shelving system.

To determine Megan's total literary assemblage:
- We start with her collection of mysteries, which is comprised of 8 individual units (shelves), each cradling precisely seven novels—a classic arrangement that not only facilitates easy access but also maintains a visual uniformity. Multiplying the number of shelves by books per unit yields:
  8 mystery bookcases * 7 mysteries/bookcase = 56 mysterious tales, each whispering secrets and suspense into eager minds seeking adventure within their pages.
- Next in line are her picture books—a collection that's notably smaller but no less significant for its visual appeal: two shelves dedicated to these illustrated stories with a charm all of their own; multiplying the number by seven gives us an additional 14 vibrant volumes, each page bursting into color and life.
- To ascertain Megan's entire literary collection housed within her bookcase sanctuary: we sum up both totals—56 mysteries plus another set of visual delights in the form of picture books (which is 14), culminating to a grand total that stands at an impressive figure.
- The arithmetic operation here involves simple multiplication followed by addition, which yields Megan's comprehensive book count: combining her mystery novels and illustrated stories results in exactly seventy volumes—a testament not only to the breadth of genres she cherishes but also a reflection on how diverse interests can coexist harmoniously within one’s personal library.
- In summary, Megan'seight shelves dedicated exclusively for her mystery novels and two additional ones reserved solely for picture books—each with seven volumes per designated space—culminate in an overall total of seventy literary pieces that form the cornerstone of a well-rounded reading habit.

Thus, Megan's bookcase is not merely storage; it’seight shelves dedicated exclusively to her mystery novels and two additional ones reserved solely for picture books—each with seven volumes per designated space culminate in an overall total of seventy literary pieces that form the cornerstone of a well-rounded reading habit.

In essence, Megan's bookcase stands as more than just rows upon shelves; it is rather a curated collection where each mystery novel and picture book has its place—a testament to her love for literature in all forms: the thrill of unraveling mysteries alongside visual stories that dance with colorful illustrations.

To conclude, Megan's meticulous organization into eight shelves dedicated solely to her mystery novels and two additional ones reserved exclusively for picture books—each holding seven volumes per designated space results in a grand total of seventy literary pieces: an impressive collection that not only showcases the breadth but also depth of Megan's reading interests.

In summary, through this detailed examination into how each shelf is methodically stocked with precisely seven books—whether they be mystery novels or picture stories —we arrive at a grand total: seventy volumes that represent not just numbers on the page but also an organized passion for literature within Megan's personal space.

To encapsulate, by considering each shelf as containing exactly seven items and accounting separately for both her collection of mystery novels (eight in number) and picture books (two), we can calculate that she has a total summing up to seventy volumes—a substantial literary assortment reflective not only on Megan's diverse interests but also the thoughtfulness with which they are curated within their physical space",70

 Wendy's old washing machine could only wash 8 pieces of clothing at a time. If she had to wash 39 shirts and 33 sweaters how many loads would she have to do? ,"Wendy has a total of 39 shirts + 33 sweaters = 72 pieces of clothing to wash.

Since her old washing machine can only handle 8 pieces at a time, we need to divide the total number of clothes by the capacity of the machine:

72 pieces of clothing / 8 pieces per load = 9 loads

However, since you cannot do a fraction of a load in reality, if there's any remainder after dividing, Wendy would have to round up because she can't wash half a piece. In this case:

72 divided by 8 equals exactly 9 with no remainder.

So, Wendy will need to do exactly 9 loads of laundry for all her shirts and sweaters.",9

So, there would be 2 pictures in each of the three albums.",2
" While playing at the arcade, Frank won 33 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 9 tickets playing 'skee ball'. If he was trying to buy candy that cost 6 tickets a piece, how many could he buy? ","Frank has a total of 33 (from whack a mole) + 9 (from skee ball) = 42 tickets.

Since each candy costs 6 tickets, we divide the total number of tickets by the cost per candy:

42 tickets /  extraneous information such as decimals or fractions is not needed here because you can only buy whole pieces of candy with a given amount. So he could purchase floor(42/6) = 7 candies, where 'floor' means we take the largest integer less than or equal to the division result (since partial candies are not possible).

Therefore, Frank can buy 7 pieces of candy at the arcade with his tickets.",7
" Mike made 14 dollars mowing lawns and 26 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 5 dollar a week, how long would the money last him? "," To find out how long Mike's earnings will last if he spends $5 per week, first calculate his total earnings:

Mike made $14 from mowing lawns and $26 from weed eating. So, his total earnings are:
$14 + $26 = $40

Now, divide his total earnings by the amount he spends per week to find out how many weeks the money will last him:

$40 ÷ $5/week = 8 weeks

So, Mike'thy money would last him for 8 weeks if he only spent $5 each week.",8

For every 3 pounds recycled, they earn one point. To find out how many points they earned for the entire amount:

Total Points = Total Pounds Recycled / Pounds per Point

So, we divide 18 by 3 to get the total number of points:

Total Points = 18 / dict(pounds=3)

This gives us a result of 6.

Therefore, Gwen and her friends earned 6 points for recycling paper.",6

" For Halloween Megan received 11 pieces of candy from neighbors and 5 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 8 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her? ","Megan has a total of:

11 (from neighbors) + 5 (from her sister) = 16 pieces of candy

If Megan eats 8 pieces a day, we can divide the total number of candies by the daily consumption to find out how many days it will last:

16 pieces /  extraneous information such as age or time preferences. However, I'll provide you with both calculations for each scenario assuming she only eats candy on Halloween night (day one) and then continues at that rate every day thereafter until the candies run out.

If Megan starts by consuming all 16 pieces in a single sitting:
The candy would last her just 1 day, as it's not possible to eat more than what she has collected on Halloween night without additional sources of sweets or resupply from neighbors and family.

If Megan eats candies at the rate of 8 pieces per day:
To calculate how many days her candy will last, we divide the total number by daily consumption:
16 (total pieces) / 8 (pieces/day) = exactly 2 days
So if she continues to eat them steadily every single day without any additional candies being added or taken away from what'd be left over after Halloween night, her candy would last for two full days. However, since we are considering the context of a one-day event like Halloween and not an ongoing supply situation:
16 pieces / 8 (pieces/day) = exactly 2 days into consumption beyond just that day itself; thus it's more accurate to say her candy would last for only partway through Day 3, with some candies remaining after Halloween night. If she eats them on consecutive days starting from the next one (Day 1), then by end of Day 2 or beginning of Day 3, all will be consumed and possibly none left to eat beyond that point if we strictly adhere only to those two pieces per day without considering any additional candies.

In a real-world scenario where Megan might not consume the same amount every single day due to various reasons (like wanting some for later or getting more from others), it's likely her candy would last longer than just these calculated days, but with given information and assuming constant consumption: two full consecutive days.",2

To find out how many full baggies she can make, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per baggie:

35 cookies ÷ dict(5) cookies/baggy = dict(7) full baggies

Maria can make 7 full baggies with 5 cookies each. There will be some leftover cookies because 35 is not a multiple of 5, but since we are only counting complete baggies, the answer remains 7.",7

10 players / 5 players per group = 2 groups

So, there would be 2 complete groups of 5 players each. If any remaining players were left out because they don't make up a full group, you could consider forming an additional smaller group for them or discuss with the coach how to handle this situation since it seems like all players can fit into two equal-sized groups in this case.",2

5 (initial) + 35 (new arrivals) = 40 puppies

If 8 puppies are adopted each day, we can calculate how many days it will take for all of them to be adopted by dividing the total number of puppies by the daily adoption rate:

40 puppies / dict(puppy_per_day=8) = dict(days=5 with a remainder of 0, meaning exactly 5 days are needed without any remaining.

So it would take exactly 5 days for all 40 puppies to be adopted at the rate of 8 per day.",5
" Nancy's class is going on a field trip to the zoo. If each van can hold 5 people and there are 12 students and 3 adults going, how many vans will they need? ","To find out how many vans are needed, we first need to determine the total number of passengers:

Number of students = 12
Number of adults = 3
Total passengers = 12 + 3 = 15

Each van can hold 5 people. To calculate the minimum number of vans required for all passengers, we divide the total number of passengers by the capacity of each van:

Vans needed = Total passengers / Van capacity
            = 15 / 5
            
Since you cannot have a fraction of a van and they need to transport everyone at once (assuming no partial trips), rounding up is necessary if there's any remainder. In this case, the division results in exactly:

Vans needed = 3

So Nancy’s class will require three vans for their field trip to the zoo with all students and adults accommodated without leaving anyone behind or having empty seats on a van.",3
" Dave was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 9 trays at a time.

First set: 17 trays
Second set: 55 trays

For the first table, we divide 17 by 9 to find out how many full trips he can make and if there'm any remaining trays. This gives us:

17 ÷ 9 = 1 with a remainder of 8 (since 9 * 1 = 9 and 17 - 9 = 8). So, Dave will need to make one full trip for the first table plus an additional trip for the remaining trays. That's 2 trips so far.

For the second table with 55 trays:

55 ÷ 9 = 6 with a remainder of 1 (since 9 * 6 = 54 and 55 - 54 = 1). Dave will need to make six full trips for this set, plus one more trip for the remaining tray. That's 7 trips in total so far.

Adding both sets together:
2 (from the first table) + 7 (from the second table) = 9 trips in total.

Dave will make a total of 9 trips to pick up all the lunch trays from both tables.",8
" For a birthday party George bought 10 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 4 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up?

Total sodas = Total regular sodas + Total diet sodas
Total sodas = 1 extraneous information (the type of soda doesn't affect the number of shelves needed)

Now, we divide the total number of sodas by the capacity per shelf:

Total sodas / Capacity per shelf = Number of shelves filled up

To find out the total number of trips he needs to make for both tables, we need to calculate each separately:

For the first table with 29 trays:
- After one trip, he picks up 9 trays, leaving 20 trays (29 - 9 = 20).
- On his second trip, he can carry another 9 trays, which leaves 11 trays (20 - dict(tract=9) = 11).
- For the third and final trip for this table, he picks up the remaining 11 trays.

So, Henry makes a total of 3 trips to clear all the trays from the first table.

For the second table with 52 trays:
- After one trip, he clears off 9 trays (leaving him with 43 trays).
- On his next two trips, he can carry another set of 9 each time, which leaves us with a remainder after three full sets. That's nine times in total for this table: \(52 \div 9 = 5\) (with a remainder), so Henry makes five complete trips and one final trip to pick up the remaining trays.

Adding both tables together, we have:

- On his first trip, he picks up 8 trays. That leaves him with 1 more to pick up (9 - 8 = 1).
- He will need a second trip for the remaining tray.

" A vase can hold 5 flowers. If you had 6 carnations and 19 roses, how many vases would you need to hold the flowers? "," You have a total of 6 + 19 = 25 flowers (carnations and roses combined). Since each vase can hold 5 flowers, you would divide the total number of flowers by the capacity of one vase:

25 flowers / dict(flowers_per_vase=5) = 5 vases with a remainder.

Since you cannot have a fraction of a vase and all remaining flowers must go into another full vase, you would need 6 vases to hold all the flowers (5 full ones for the first 25 flowers, plus one additional vase for any extra). However, in this case, there are no extras because exactly 25 is divisible by 5. So, you will only need:

25 / 5 = 5 vases to hold all the carnations and roses without leaving any flowers out of a vase.",5

Haley recycled 11 pounds. Her friends recycled an additional 16 pounds. Together, that's a total of:

11 + 16 = 27 pounds

" A pet shelter had 17 puppies when another 55 were brought in. If 8 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted? "," First, let's find out the total number of puppies at the pet shelter after the additional 55 were brought in:

17 (initially) + 55 (brought in) = 72 puppies

Now, if 8 puppies are adopted each day, we can divide the total number of puppies by the daily adoption rate to find out how many days it will take for all the puppies to be adopted:

72 puppies / dict(puppy_per_day=8) = dict(days=9 with a remainder of 0, meaning exactly 9 full days are needed without any remaining puppies.

So, it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted if they continue at this rate and there'm no changes in adoption speed or additional arrivals.",9
" There school's baseball team had 12 new players and 44 returning players. If the coach put them into groups with 8 players in each group, how many groups would there be? "," To find out how many groups of 8 can be made from the total number of players (both new and returning), first we need to calculate the total number of players:

12 new players + 44 returning players = 56 players in total.

Now, divide the total number of players by the number of players per group:

56 players ÷ 8 players/group = 7 groups.

So there would be 7 complete groups of 8 players each. If you need to account for any remaining players that don't fit into these full groups, you can calculate a remainder using the modulo operation (which gives you what is left over after division):

56 % 8 = 0 leftover players.

Since there are no leftovers in this case, all of the players will be evenly distributed into complete groups with none remaining without forming an additional group. Therefore, exactly 7 full groups can be formed from these baseball team members for practice or games requiring such a grouping system.",7

" A pet shelter had 8 puppies when another 19 were brought in. If 3 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted? "," Initially, the shelter has 8 puppies. After receiving an additional 19 puppies, the total number becomes:

8 + 19 = 27 puppies

If 3 puppies are adopted each day, we can calculate how many days it will take for all of them to be adopted by dividing the total number of puppies by the daily adoption rate:

27 puppies / dict(puppy_per_day=3) = 9 days

So, it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted at a rate of 3 per day. However, since you can't adopt a fraction of a dog on any given day, if there are remaining dogs after full sets of three have been taken away each day, they will still need an additional day even though not enough time has passed for another complete set to be adopted:

9 days (for 27 puppies) + 1 extra day = 10 total adoption days.

Therefore, it would take a full ten days for all the puppies at this shelter to find homes if they continue being taken away three by one each day until there are none left or just enough remaining that cannot form another complete group of three on the final day.",9

For Bianca alone: 24 pounds / 3 pounds per point = 8 points

Her friends recycled an additional 3 pounds, which is exactly one ""batch"" or group that can be converted into a single point (since it's not enough for another full batch of 3):

For her friends: 3 pounds / 3 pounds per point = 1 point

If he spends all his earnings on something that costs exactly $3 a week, then the money would last him for 2 weeks. Here's how:

" Robin was making baggies of cookies with 6 cookies in each bag. If she had 23 chocolate chip cookies and 25 oatmeal cookies, how many baggies could she make? ","To find out how many complete baggies Robin can make, we need to divide the total number of each type of cookie by 6 (since there are 6 cookies in each bag) and then take the smaller whole number result because you cannot have a partial bag.

For chocolate chip cookies:
23 ÷ dict(chocolate_chips=6)= approximately 3 baggies with some leftover (since we can't make a fraction of a cookie into a full bag). The whole number result is 3, which means she can make 3 complete chocolate chip cookies bags.

For oatmeal cookies:
25 ÷ dict(oatmeal_cookies=6)= approximately 4 baggies with some leftover (again taking the whole number result). She can make 4 complete oatmeal cookie bags.

Since she cannot mix types of cookies in a bag, we must consider only full sets that use all six spots for one type or another:
- With chocolate chip cookies alone, Robin could fill up to 3 baggies (since making more would require additional cookies).
- Similarly with oatmeal cookies alone, she can make exactly 4 complete baggies.

Since the number of full sets is limited by whichever type gives us fewer completed bags and we cannot mix types in a bag here: Robin could only create as many total baggies as there are chocolate chip cookie ones because that's less than oatmeal cookies, which would be 3 complete baggies.

Therefore, the answer is she can make 3 full baggies of either type with no leftover spots for a mixed bag in this scenario (assuming we are not mixing cookie types within each individual filled-bag). If Robin wanted to mix cookies and still fill as many complete sets possible without leaving any space, it would require additional oatmeal or chocolate chip cookies.",8
 The schools debate team had 5 boys and 40 girls on it.

45 students ÷ dict(group_size=9) = dict(quotient=5 groups with a remainder)

This means that you can make 5 full groups of 9 out of the debate team. There will be some students left over who won't fit into these complete groups:

45 modulo 9 (remainder when dividing by 9) = 0 remaining students

Since there is no remainder, all members can be evenly divided into groups of 9 without any student being left out. Therefore, the debate team can make exactly 5 full groups with each group containing 9 students.",5

48 sodas ÷ dict(shelf_capacity=6) = dict(full_shelves=8).

So, Cody would fill up 8 shelves in his fridge. However, since you can't use a fraction of a shelf (assuming each shelf must be completely full to count), and there are no partial sodas, the answer remains that he will have exactly 8 filled shelves with all their capacity used for storing the sodas.",8

Each van can hold 8 people. To find out how many vans are needed, we divide the total number of passengers by the capacity of one van:

24 passengers / 8 passengers per van = 3 vans

However, since you cannot have a fraction of a van and all students must be transported safely, if there's any remainder after division, an additional van would still be required. In this case, the number divides evenly:

" A pet shelter had 2 puppies when another 34 were brought in. If 4 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted? "," Initially, the shelter has 2 puppies. After bringing in an additional 34 puppies, there will be:

2 (initial) + 34 (new arrivals) = 36 puppies in total.

If 4 puppies are adopted each day, we can calculate the number of days it would take for all the puppies to be adopted by dividing the total number of puppies by the daily adoption rate:

36 (total puppies) /  extraneous information. We only need the initial and additional numbers along with the daily adoption rate, which are provided as follows: Initially there were 2 puppies in the shelter; an extra batch of 34 puppies was brought into the facility to join them for a total before any adoptive actions took place—this gives us our starting point. With each day that passes and assuming exactly four adoptions occur daily, we can determine how many days it will take until there are no more puppies left in need of homes within this shelter environment by dividing the entire count into these consistent weekly intakes:

36 (total number after new arrivals) / 4 (adoptions per day). This calculation yields exactly nine, indicating that without any further complications or changes to adoption rates—such as holidSetup errors in previous calculations. Here's the corrected step-by-step process for determining how long it would take for all puppies at a shelter with an initial count of 2 and additional arrivals amounting to another batch of 34, assuming that four are adopted each day:

1. Start by acknowledging there were initially two puppies in the pet shelter. This is our base number before any new additions or adoptions occur within this scenario's timeframe. It sets a clear starting point for further calculations and understanding of how many animals we begin with, which are essential to solving problems related to population changes over discrete intervals such as days:
2. Recognize that an additional 34 puppies were brought into the shelter after these initial two had already been there—this is a significant influx increasing our total count and directly impacting how quickly adoptions can occur, given we now have more animals to find homes for daily at this rate:
   - The combined number of dogs in the pet shelter following their arrivals becomes 36. This figure represents not just an accumulation but also a critical threshold that will determine our timeline calculations moving forward—it's where all subsequent adoptions begin, and it is essential to know because we must work from this total:
   - With four puppies finding new homes each day through the shelter’s efforts or community outreach programs (assuming a steady rate of daily adoptive events), calculating how many days will pass until there are no more dogs left in need at that facility becomes our primary objective—this is not just an academic exercise but has real-world implications for animal welfare and resource allocation:
   - By dividing the total number after new arrivals (36) by the daily adoption rate of four, we arrive precisely at nine days. This straightforward division provides a clear timeline—without any further complicating factors such as additional intakes or changes in how many animals are adopted each day:
   - The result is an unambiguous and definitive answer to our initial question; it takes exactly nine full cycles of daily adoptions for all the puppies at this shelter, given no other variables come into play (such as more arrivals being brought in or a change in how many are adopted each day), until there will be zero animals left waiting. This timeline is critical to understand and plan around within any animal welfare context:
   - The final answer—nine days, which succinctly encapsulates the entire process of calculation from initial conditions through daily adoptions without extraneous information or miscalculations that could muddy our understanding of how quickly these animals can find homes. This clarity is essential for anyone involved in managing such a shelter and ensuring they have accurate expectations about their capacity to help:
   - The answer, therefore—nine days as the timeframe required under current conditions (no additional puppies arriving after this point) until all animals are adopted from our initial pet shelter scenario. This is not just an abstract number but a concrete timeline that can be used for planning and resource allocation within animal shelters or similar contexts:
   - In summary, the process of calculating how long it would take to adopt out 36 puppies at this rate results in exactly nine days—this answer is derived from understanding initial conditions (",9
 At a company picnic 9 managers and 15 employees decided to start a game of volleyball. If they split into 8 teams how many people would be on each team? ,"To find out how many people would be on each team, we first need to determine the total number of people playing:

However, since you can't have a fraction of a person on a team, this distribution means that some teams will have more members than others if they were to divide equally without considering the number as whole persons only. In reality, one possible way to distribute them could involve having three full teams with 3 players each and two additional teams where four managers join an employee (making five people on those two teams), or some other arrangement that accounts for all individuals being included in a team setup while acknowledging the indivisible nature of persons.",3

" Billy was organizing his baseball cards in a binder with 5 on each page. If he had 3 new cards and 42 old cards to put in the binder, how many pages would he use? "," First, we need to find out the total number of cards Billy has:

Since each page can hold 5 baseball cards, we divide the total number of cards by the number of cards per page to find out how many pages he would need:

45 cards ÷ dict(cards_per_page=5)= dict(pages=9)

Billy would use 9 pages in his binder. However, since you can't have a fraction of a page and we assume that each card must go on its own separate page (no partial filling), Billy will need exactly 9 full pages to organize all his cards with none left over or partially filled.",9
" For a birthday party Tom bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 7 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up? ","Tom has a total of 4 (regular) + 52 (diet) = 56 sodas.

56 sodas ÷ dict(shelf_capacity=7) = dict(full_shelves=8 with a remainder).

Since you can't have a fraction of a filled shelf, the remaining soda would not fill up an entire additional shelf. Therefore, Tom will completely fill up 8 shelves in his fridge for the sodas.",8
" Victor was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 7 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 23 trays from one table and 5 trays from another, how many trips will he make? "," Victor can carry 7 trays per trip. He has two groups of trays: 23 trays from the first table and 5 trays from the second table. Let's calculate each group separately to find out how many trips he will make for each, then we can add them together if necessary.

For the first table with 23 trays:
- On his first trip, Victor picks up 7 trays (because that'seven). He has 16 trays left to carry (23 - 7 = 16).
- On his second trip, he again carries 7 more trays. Now there are only 9 trays remaining (16 - 7 = 9).
- For the third and final round for this table, Victor picks up another set of 7 trays but will have to carry just 2 on his last trip because he can't make a partial load. So that makes it three trips in total (two full loads plus one with two remaining).

For the second table with 5 trays:
- Since there are fewer than seven, Victor only needs to do this as one single trip since all five will fit on his cart at once.

Adding them up for both tables gives us a total of four trips (three from the first table and one from the second). 

So, Victor makes **four trips** in total picking up trays from these two tables.",4

" Debby's class is going on a field trip to the zoo. If each van can hold 9 people and there are 40 students and 14 adults going, how many vans will they need? "," To find out how many vans are needed, we first need to determine the total number of people going on the field trip:

Total people = Number of students + Number of adults
                    = 40 students + 14 adults
                    = 54 people

Now that we know there are 54 people in total, and each van can hold 9 people, we divide the number of people by the capacity of one van:

Number of vans needed (without considering any remainder) = Total people / Van's capacity
                                                             = 54 / 9
                                                             = 6

Since you cannot have a fraction of a van and we can only use whole numbers, no further calculation is necessary here because the result is an exact number. Therefore:

They will need exactly **6 vans** to transport all students and adults for their field trip to the zoo without any people left over or in need of another vehicle.",6
" For Halloween Emily received 5 pieces of candy from neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 9 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her? ","Emily has a total of:

If Emily eats 9 pieces a day, we can divide the total number of candies by the daily consumption to find out how many days they will last her:

18 pieces /  extraneous information such as age or time-specific events like Halloween are not relevant for calculating candy duration. The calculation is purely based on quantity and rate of intake, which in this case would be straightforward division without considering any external factors beyond the scope provided by your question:

18 pieces / 9 pieces per day = 2 days

" At a restaurant each adult meal costs $5 and kids eat free. If a group of 15 people came in and 8 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?

Total cost for adults = Number of adults × Cost per adult
Total cost for adults = 7 × $5
Total cost for adults = $35

Since kids eat free, their meals do not add any additional cost. Therefore, the total cost for the group to eat at the restaurant is just the cost for the adults:

"," The chef still needs to cook 7 more potatoes (since he has already cooked 8 out of 15). Each batch can include any number up to his capacity. Assuming that each remaining potato takes individually 9 minutes, we calculate:

Time for one potato = 9 minutes  
Number of uncooked potatoes left = 7   
Total time needed if cooking them separately would be Time per Potato × Number of Uncooked Potatoes Left.

So the total additional cooking time required is:

Therefore, it will take him an extra 63 minutes to finish cooking the remaining seven potatoes if he'dicts them one after another without any breaks or multitasking. If his method of preparation allows for multiple potatoes being in the oven at once (assuming they all fit and are done simultaneously), then it would take only 9 more minutes to finish cooking, which is just enough time as each batch takes that long regardless of size due to their individual required cook times.

Assuming he can't multitask or use multiple ovens:  
Total additional cooking time = **63 minutes** (if one potato at a time). If using an appropriate number of pots simultaneously, it would be just 9 more minutes in total to finish the task.",63

" A chef needs to cook 13 potatoes. He has already cooked 5. If each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, how long will it take him to cook the rest? "," The chef still needs to cook 13 - dictated by subtraction:

8 remaining potatoes = Total number of potatoes (13) - Number already cooked (5).

Each potato takes 6 minutes, so for one more batch that can fit into the oven at once with all these eight potatoes it would take him exactly those 6 minutes. However, if he has to do this in multiple rounds because his kitchen equipment doesn'thy hold them all simultaneously (which is a common scenario), we need additional information about how many each round could handle for an accurate calculation of total time required:

- If the oven can only fit one potato at once and it takes 6 minutes per cooking, then he would spend approximately 48 minutes to finish all remaining (because there are eight left). Here's why: Each batch is six minutes long. So for each of these individual times added together gives us a total time spent on the task which equals
(1 + 2 + ...+ 8) *6 = sum from n=0 to N-1 where N here represents number potatoes (which are eight). The formula used above is summation, and it's equal to ((N*(N+1))/2)*T. Substituting the values in:
((8*9)/2) * 6 = sum from n=0 to seven of six minutes each equals forty-eight (48). So if he can only cook one potato at a time, it will take him about an hour and fourteen minutes.
  
Remember that this calculation assumes the chef has just enough oven space for these eight remaining items without any downtime in between rounds of baking: real-world scenarios might involve additional waiting times due to preparation or cleaning up, which could increase total time spent on cooking task further. 

Without specific information about his kitchen equipment and how many potatoes he can fit into the oven at once (or if there are any other constraints), this is a rough estimate based only upon provided data: eight remaining items each taking six minutes to prepare, totalling approximately an hour and fourteen additional minutes. 
  
Always remember that these calculations assume ideal conditions without considering real-world factors like preparation time or cleaning up after cooking which could add extra duration in actual scenarios! But as a basic calculation based on the provided data: it would take around one hundred forty (140) additional minutes to finish all remaining potatoes.

17 (total needed) - 8 (already baked) = 9 more brownies

If each brownie requires 8 cups of flour, then for the remaining 9 brownies, Tiffany will need:

9 (brownies left to make) x 8 (cups of flour per brownie) = 72 cups of flour

7 tickets * $9/ticket = $63

Adam spent $63 riding the ferris wheel.",63
" A worksheet had 7 problems on it. If a teacher had 17 worksheets to grade and had already graded 8 of them, how many more problems does she have to grade? ","The teacher has not yet started grading the number of problems for each ungraded sheet; they are independent tasks regardless of whether other sheets have been completed. Here's what we can calculate:

- There are a total of \(7 \times 17 = 119\) math problems across all worksheets (since there are 7 problems per worksheet and the teacher has 17 worksheets).
- The teacher already graded \(8 \times 7 = 56\) problems.

To find out how many more problems she needs to grade, subtract the number of problems already graded from the total:
\(119 - 56 = 63\).

So there are still 63 math problems left for her to grade on all remaining worksheets (which is \(17 - 8 = 9\) ungraded sheets). Each of these has 7 problems, so she will have exactly the same number:
\(9 \times 7 = 63\).

Therefore, regardless of how many more papers there are to grade on each sheet (which is always \(7\)), it still totals up to \(63\) math problems left for grading.",63

" Edward earned 9 dollars for each lawn he mowed. If he had 6 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 2 of them, how much money did he actually earn? ","Edward planned to mow 6 lawns and would have earned $9 per lawn if all were completed. However, since he only mowed 4 out of those 6 lawns (because he forgot to mow 2), we can calculate his earnings as follows:

Number of lawns actually mowed = Total planned - Lawns forgotten
                                = 6 - dict(forgotten_lawns)
                                = 6 - 2
                                = 4

Earnings from the actual number of lawns he did mow:
Total earnings = Number of lawns actually mowed × Earnings per lawn
               = dict(actual_mowed_lawns) × $9/lawn
               = 4 × $9

Out of a group of 9 people, if 2 are children (kids), then that leaves us with 7 adults (because 9 - 2 = 7).

Each adult meal costs $2, so for 7 paying customers we would multiply the number of adults by the cost per adult:

7 adults × $2/adult = $14.

Therefore, it will cost $1thy to feed this group at the restaurant since all kids eat free and only the parents or guardians are paying for their meals.",14

 Wendy uploaded 79 pictures to Facebook. She put 44 pics into one album and put the rest into 5 different albums. How many pictures were in each album? ," To find out how many pictures are left after putting 44 into one album, we subtract those from the total number of pictures:

79 (total pictures) - 44 (pictures in one album) = 35 pictures remaining.

Now, Wendy wants to distribute these 35 pictures evenly across 5 different albums. To find out how many are in each album, we divide the number of remaining pictures by the number of albums:

35 (remaining pictures) / dict(number_of_albums=5)= dict(picture_per_album=7).

So, there would be 7 pictures in each of the five different albums. However, it'mpossible to divide them evenly because 35 is not divisible by 5 without a remainder (since we are dealing with whole numbers and you can’t have a fraction of a picture on an album). The correct division should result in:

dict(picture_per_album=7) = dict(number_of_pictures/alarmms)=35 / 5, which equals exactly 7 pictures per album. So Wendy would indeed place precisely 7 pictures into each of the five albums without any leftovers in this case.",7
" Isabel had 72 homework problems. She finished 32 of them but still had 5 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?

How many pictures were in each album? ," If Bianca put 27 pictures into one album, then she had 33 -  extraneous information here because we only need to consider how many are left after placing those 27 pics:

Remaining pictures = Total pictures - Pictures in the first album
                   = 33 - 27
                   = 6 pictures.

These remaining 6 pictures were distributed into 3 different albums, so to find out how many are in each of these three albums we divide:

Pictures per additional album = Remaining pictures / Number of other albums
                             = 6 / 3
                             = 2 pictures.

So there would be 2 pictures in each of the remaining three albums, assuming an even distribution among them.",2
" Emily's team won their dodgeball game and scored 39 points total. If Emily scored 23 of the points and everyone else scored 2 points each, how many players were on her team? ","If Emily scored 23 points, we need to subtract those from the total score to find out how many points the rest of the team scored. So:

39 (total points) - 23 (Emily's points) = 16 points for the rest of the team.

Since each player other than Emily scores 2 points, we can divide the remaining points by 2 to find out how many players there are besides her:

16 / 2 = 8 players on the team excluding Emily.

Including Emily in the count, that makes a total of:

8 (other players) + 1 (Emily herself) = 9 players on the team.",8

","If there were originally 47 invitees and only 39 showed up (since 47 - 7 = 39), we can divide this number by the capacity of each table to find out how many tables are needed. Since one table holds 5 people:

39 invited guests / 5 people per table = 7.8 tables

Since you cannot have a fraction of a table, they would need 8 tables to seat all the attendees (with some extra space on two of them).",8
" A waiter had 44 customers in his section. If 12 of them left and the rest of his tables had 8 people at each table, how many tables did he have? ","After 12 customers leave, the waiter has 44 -  extraneous information (the initial number of customers) that is not needed for this calculation. We only need to consider the remaining customers and the fact that there are groups of 8 at each table:

Remaining customers = Total original customers - Customers who left
                   = 44 - 12
                   = 32 customers

Now, we divide the number of remaining customers by the number of people per table to find out how many tables there are:

Number of tables = Remaining customers / People per table
                = 32 / 8
                = 4 tables

So, the waiter had 4 tables with groups of 8 at each.",4

shelves_needed = ceiling(27 / 3)
shelves_needed = ceiling(9)
shelves_needed = 9 (since 9 is already an integer, no rounding up needed).

Jerry will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.",9

Will can buy 9 four-dollar toys with the money he has left after purchasing the new game.",9
 Bianca was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 52 seeds and planted 40 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 2 seeds each. How many small gardens did Bianca have? ,"Bianca used 40 seeds for the big garden, so we need to subtract that number from the total amount she started with to find out how many seeds were left for her small gardens:

52 seeds - 40 seeds = 12 seeds

Since Bianca put 2 seeds in each of her small gardens, we divide the remaining seeds by 2 to find out how many small gardens she had:

12 seeds /  extraneous information or a mistake. The number should be divisible evenly when divided into groups of two for whole small gardens without any leftover seeds (since you can't have part of a garden). Let’s correct the calculation by using an appropriate total seed count that, after planting 40 in the big garden and allocating them to her small gardens with each receiving exactly 2.

Assuming Bianca had at least one whole number amount for seeds left:
51 (or another even divisible figure) - 40 = remaining_seeds, where 'remaining_seeds' must be an even number since she plants them in pairs into small gardens. Let’s choose a correct total seed count that makes sense; let us say Bianca started with 62 seeds instead:

62 - 40 = remaining_seeds, which gives us 22 seeds for the smaller garden plots. Now we divide by two to find out how many small gardens she could have made:

22 / 2 = number of small gardens
11 = number of small gardens

So Bianca had enough remaining seed count (62 - 40) and planted them into her smaller garden plots with each receiving two seeds, resulting in a total of 11 such small gardens.",6

 Isabel uploaded 25 pictures to Facebook. She put 10 pics into one album and put the rest into 5 different albums. How many pictures were in each album? ," If Isabel placed 10 pictures into one album, she would have 25 -  extraneous information here since we are not told how these remaining photos are distributed among the other five albums. Without this specific distribution detail or additional constraints on what needs to be calculated (e.g., each of those albums having an equal number of pics), it's impossible to determine exactly how many pictures were in each album from the information given alone.

However, if we assume that she distributed all remaining photos equally among the five different albums after placing 10 into one:

Firstly, subtract the initial set (the first ten) which leaves us with \(25 - 10 = 15\) pictures to distribute amongst the other five albums. If these are divided evenly, each of those would contain \(\frac{15}{5} = 3\) photos in their respective album(s).

So under this assumption: one album has 10 pics and four others have three pics each (assuming an equal distribution among the five albums after placing ten into a single one), but without further information, we cannot be certain of how she distributed them.",3
" Sarah had 60 homework problems. She finished 20 of them but still had 5 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?

She started with 60 problems and completed 20, so she has:

60 - 20 = 40 problems left

Now, these remaining 40 problems are spread across the pages that Sarah still needs to do work on. Since there are 5 pages of problems left for her to complete, we can divide the number of unfinished problems by the number of pages to find out how many problems are on each page:

40 problems / 5 pages = 8 problems per page

" Will had 59 pieces of clothing to wash. He put 32 of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into 9 equal loads. How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads? "," To find out how many pieces of clothing Will can put in each of the smaller loads, we first need to determine how many items are left after he puts away the initial load:

59 (total pieces) - 32 (pieces already washed) = 27 pieces remaining.

Now, these 27 pieces will be split into 9 equal loads:

27 /  extraneous_code |=|- Python code to calculate the number of items per load without using division directly in plain text here is not necessary as we can perform simple arithmetic operations manually or with a calculator. Here's how you would do it step by step, assuming no remainder:

27 (remaining pieces) / 9 (loads) = 3 pieces per load.

So Will could put exactly 3 pieces of clothing in each of the smaller loads if they are divided equally without any leftovers. However, since we cannot perform division directly here as requested:

To divide these remaining clothes into equal parts using a method that doesn't involve direct calculation (like long division), you would proceed by repeatedly subtracting 9 from 27 until the remainder is less than 9 and count how many times this subtraction occurs. In each step, one load of clothing gets washed:

1st Load: Subtract once - Remaining clothes = 18 (after removing these pieces for a new small load)
2nd Load: Subtract again – Now we have removed another set equivalent to the first smaller load. The remaining are now down to just enough clothing that can be divided into two more loads of three each, which is exactly what's needed here without any remainder or leftover clothes for additional small washing loads.

Thus, Will could put 3 pieces in each of the nine smaller laundry loads after his initial load with no clothing left out unaccounted-for and not requiring further division beyond this point to maintain equal distribution among all remaining loads.",3

$28 ÷ $4 per game = 7 games.

Oliver can buy 7 four-dollar games with the money he has left after purchasing new mower blades.",7
 Emily was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 42 seeds and planted 36 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 2 seeds each.

42 seeds - 36 seeds = 6 seeds remaining.

Since Emily put 2 seeds in each of her small gardens, we divide the remaining seeds by 2 to find out how many small gardens she had:

6 seeds /  extraneous information or assumptions are needed here because with only this data provided and assuming that all used seeds went into planting without any waste, Emily could have a maximum of 3 small gardens (as having more would require additional seeds). Here's the calculation for up to three:

6 remaining seeds / 2 seeds per garden = 3 small gardens.

So, if she used all her available seeds without any leftover or waste, Emily had exactly 3 small gardens with an equal number of plants in each one (using the assumption that every seed planted results in a single vegetable). However, it's important to note this is based on perfect division and actual gardening might involve some seeds not being used due to various reasons.

If there are additional details or constraints about how many small gardens she could have (like having at least one seed per plant), please provide them for a more accurate answer, as the current information suggests exactly 3 without any ambiguity under perfect conditions.",3

18 pictures /  least of two equivalent expressions that represent how many pics are now divided into each of those nine other albums. Simplifying this expression gives us an exact number for one album without fractions or decimals, as we assume Wendy can only upload whole photos to a single photo in Facebook:

So each of those nine albums will have exactly two pictures. The final answer is that there are now 2 pictures in each of the other nine albums, along with one containing 27 pictures.",2

He then packed these remaining games into boxes with 4 games in each box. To find out how many full boxes he could make, we divide the number of games by the number of games per box:

20 / dict(games_per_box=4) = dict(full_boxes=5).

This means Luke used 5 full boxes to pack his remaining games. However, since you cannot have a fraction of a physical box when dealing with actual items like game cases, we don't need to consider any partial use here because the division resulted in an integer value (no remainder), indicating that all available space was perfectly filled by whole boxes without leftover room for another full set.

So Luke used 5 boxes in total.",5
" Haley baked 20 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 11 of them how many packages could she make if she put 3 cupcake in each package? ","If Haley had 20 cupcakes and Todd ate 11, then there are:

20 - 11 = 9 cupcakes left.

Since she wants to make packages with 3 cupcakes in each package, we can divide the remaining number of cupcakes by 3:

9 / 3 = 3 packages.

Haley could make 3 full packages of cupcakes for the bake sale.",3
 A pet store had 13 puppies. In one day they sold 7 of them and put the rest into cages with 2 in each cage. How many cages did they use? ," After selling 7 out of the 13 puppies, the pet store would have 13 -  extraneous information is provided about how many were sold and not used for calculating remaining items (puppies in this case). The number left after sales doesn't matter because we are told directly that each cage holds exactly 2 puppies.

To find out the total number of cages needed, divide the leftover puppies by how many can fit into one cage:
13 (total initial) - 7 (sold) = 6 remaining puppies to be placed in cages.
Since each cage holds exactly two puppies, we would need a total of 6 / 2 = 3 cages for the six remaining puppies.",3
 A store had 27 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 6 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 7 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? ," After selling 6 out of the 27 coloring books, the store would have:

27 - 6 = 21 coloring books left.

If they put these remaining books onto shelves with 7 on each shelf, we can divide the total number of books by the number of books per shelf to find out how many shelves they used:

21 ÷ dict(books_per_shelf=7) = dict(number_of_shelves=3).

So, they would have used 3 shelves.",3
 Wendy had 82 files on her computer. She deleted 37 of them and put the rest into folders with 5 files in each one. How many folders did Wendy end up with? ,"First, let's find out how many files Wendy has left after deleting some:

82 (original number of files) - 37 (deleted files) = 45 (remaining files)

Now, we need to divide the remaining files into folders with 5 files in each one:

45 (remaining files) / dict(files=5 per folder) = 9 folders

Wendy ended up with 9 folders.",9
" Kaleb had 12 dollars. If he spent 8 bucks on a new game, how many 2 dollar toys could he buy with the money he had left? ","Kaleb started with $12 and spent $8 on a new game. To find out how much money he has left:

$12 - $8 = $4

Now, Kaleb has $4 remaining. Each toy costs $2. To find out how many toys he can buy:

$4 ÷ $2 per toy = 2 toys

Kaleb can buy 2 two-dollar toys with the money he has left.",2
 Sarah was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 21 seeds and planted 12 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 3 seeds each. How many small gardens did Sarah have? ,"Sarah used 12 seeds for the big garden, so she had 21 - 12 = 9 seeds left for the small gardens. Since she puts 3 seeds in each of her small gardens:

Number of small gardens = Seeds for small gardens / Seeds per small garden
Number of small gardens = 9 / thy (where ""th"" represents three)

Since you can't have a fraction of a garden, we divide the seeds into whole groups of three:

9 divided by 3 equals exactly 3.

So, Sarah had 3 small gardens where she planted her vegetables with 3 seeds in each one.",3
 Nancy uploaded 51 pictures to Facebook. She put 11 pics into one album and put the rest into 8 different albums. How many pictures were in each album? ," If Nancy put 11 pictures into one album, then she distributed the remaining pictures among the other 8 albums. To find out how many pictures are left for these albums:

51 (total pictures) - 11 (pictures in one album) = 40 pictures to be divided among 8 albums.

Now, we divide the 40 pictures by the 8 albums:

40 / 8 = 5 pictures per album.

So, each of the remaining 8 albums would have 5 pictures if they were distributed evenly. However, it's important to note that this assumes an equal distribution and there might be a different arrangement in reality since we don't know how Nancy specifically chose to distribute those last few pictures (if any leftovers).",5
" A company invited 24 people to a luncheon, but 10 of them didn't show up. If the tables they had held 7 people each, how many tables do they need? ","If 10 out of the 24 invitees did not attend, then there are 24 - 10 = 14 attendees.

Since each table can hold 7 people, we divide the number of attendees by the capacity per table:

14 attendees / 7 people per table = 2 tables

So, they would need 2 tables to seat all the attending guests comfortably without exceeding the limit.",2
" Bianca's team won their dodgeball game and scored 75 points total. If Bianca scored 45 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team? ","Let's denote the number of other players (excluding Bianca) as x. Each of these players scored 6 points. Since Bianca scored 45 points herself, we can set up an equation to represent the total score:

Bianca's points + Other players' points = Total points
45 + 6x = 75

Now, let's solve for x:

6x = 75 - 45
6x = 30

Divide both sides by 6 to find the number of other players:

x = 30 / 6
x = 5

So there are 5 other players on Bianca's team. Including Bianca, that makes a total of 6 players on her dodgeball team.",5
 For Halloween Emily received 54 pieces of candy. She ate 33 pieces then placed the rest into piles with 7 in each pile. How many piles could she make? ," After eating 33 pieces of candy, Emily would have:

54 - 33 = 21 pieces left.

To find out how many piles of 7 she can make with the remaining candies, we divide 21 by 7:

21 ÷ dict(number_of_items=7) = dict(quotient=3).

So, Emily could make 3 full piles of candy with 7 pieces in each.",3
 Haley was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 56 seeds and planted 35 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 3 seeds each. How many small gardens did Haley have? ,"Haley used 35 seeds for the big garden, so we need to subtract that number from the total amount she started with to find out how many seeds were left for her small gardens:

56 (total seeds) - 35 (seeds planted in the big garden) = 21 seeds remaining for small gardens.

Since Haley puts 3 seeds in each of her small gardens, we divide the number of remaining seeds by 3 to find out how many small gardens she can create:

21 (seeds for small gardens) / thy are not divisible evenly because you cannot have a fraction of a garden. Since Haley plants whole numbers of seeds in each garden, we need to round down to the nearest whole number that is also a multiple of 3. The largest multiple of 3 less than or equal to 21 is exactly 21 (because 7 times 3 equals 21).

Therefore, Haley has enough seeds for 7 small gardens with an exact fit without any leftover seeds:

7 (small gardens) x 3 (seeds per garden) = 21 seeds used.

Hence, Haley had 7 small gardens.",7
 A store had 48 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 38 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 5 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? ," After selling 38 out of the 48 coloring books, the store would have:

48 - 38 = 10 coloring books left.

If they put these remaining books onto shelves with 5 on each shelf, we can divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf to find out how many shelves they used:

10 / 5 = 2 shelves (with no remainder).

So, they would use 2 shelves for the remaining coloring books.",2
" Roger is at the library helping put away books. There are 14 book to put away total but a librarian takes 2 of them and leaves Roger with the rest. If he can fit 3 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need? "," After the librarian takes 2 books, Roger is left with:

14 -  extraneous_books = remaining_books to put away
                        5 (since 14 - 2 = 12)

Now we divide the number of remaining books by the capacity of each shelf:

remaining_books / books_per_shelf = required_number_of_shelves
               5   /    3              ≈ 1.67

Since Roger cannot use a fraction of a shelf, he will need to round up to ensure all the remaining books have space on a shelf:

required_numberishelf + ceiling(0.67) = total_shelves needed
                          1.67  ≈ 2 (rounding up from 1.67 gives us exactly two whole numbers, which is what we need here).

So Roger will require **2 shelves** to put away the remaining books at the library.",4
 A pet store had 56 puppies. In one day they sold 24 of them and put the rest into cages with 4 in each cage. How many cages did they use? ," After selling 24 puppies, the pet store would have:

56 - 24 = 32 puppies left.

If they put these remaining puppies into cages with 4 in each cage, we can divide the number of puppies by the number of puppies per cage to find out how many cages they used:

32 / thy = 8 cages (since 32 divided by 4 equals exactly 8).

So, they would use 8 cages for the remaining puppies.",8

So, the cafeteria could make 7 apple pies with the remaining apples.",7
" Jerry had 60 pieces of clothing to wash. He put 40 of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into 5 equal loads. How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads? ","Jerry started with 60 pieces of clothing and put 40 of them in one load. This leaves him with:

60 - 40 = 20 pieces of clothing to wash in smaller loads.

He wants to split these remaining clothes into 5 equal loads, so we divide the number of remaining clothes by the number of small loads:

20 / 5 = 4 pieces of clothing per load.

So, each of the small loads would have 4 pieces of clothing.",4
" Mike made 69 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 24 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 5 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left? "," First, we need to find out how much money Mike has after spending $24 on mower blades:

69 dollars - 24 dollars = 45 dollars remaining.

Now, we'll determine how many $5 games he can buy with the remaining $45:

45 dollars /  extraneous information (since it doesn't pertain to buying video games) divided by 5 dollars/game equals 9 games.

So, Mike could buy 9 five-dollar games with the money left after purchasing new mower blades.",9
" Will made 104 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 41 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 9 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left? ","After spending $41 on new mower blades, Will would have:

$104 - $41 = $63 remaining.

To find out how many $9 games he can buy with the remaining $63, we divide the amount of money left by the cost of one game:

$63 ÷ $9 per game = 7 games.

So, Will could buy 7 games that cost $9 each with the money he had left after purchasing new mower blades.",7

                           = 4 pictures

Now she has these 4 pictures that must be divided between her next two different albums. Since there are only 2 albums and we don't have any further information about how the remaining pictures were distributed, it is not possible to determine exactly how many pics went into each of those albums without additional details or constraints (e.g., if they had an equal number in them).

If she divided these equally:
Number of pictures per album = Remaining pictures / Number of other albums
                            = 4 / 2
