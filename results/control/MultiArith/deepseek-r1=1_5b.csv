" For Halloween Debby and her sister combined the candy they received. Debby had 32 pieces of candy while her sister had 42. If they ate 35 pieces the first night, how many pieces do they have left? ","<think>
First, I need to determine the total number of candies that Debby and her sister received together. This is done by adding the candies each of them had: 32 pieces from Debby plus 42 pieces from her sister.

Next, I'll calculate how many candies were eaten on the first night. The problem states that they ate a total of 35 pieces.

Finally, to find out how many candies are left after the first night, I subtract the number of candies eaten from the total number of candies received.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Total Candies Received:**
   
   - Debby had \( 32 \) pieces of candy.
   - Her sister had \( 42 \) pieces of candy.
   
   \[
   \text{Total candies} = 32 + 42 = 74
   \]

2. **Candies Eaten on the First Night:**
   
   - They ate a total of \( 35 \) pieces of candy.

3. **Candies Left After the First Night:**
   
   \[
   \text{Candies left} = \text{Total candies} - \text{Candies eaten} = 74 - 35 = 39

 A pet store had 13 siamese cats and 5 house cats. During a sale they sold 10 cats. How many cats do they have left? ,"<think>
First, I need to determine the total number of cats in the pet store initially.

There are 13 Siamese cats and 5 house cats. Adding these together gives:

13 + 5 = 18 cats

During the sale, the pet store sold 10 cats. To find out how many cats are left, I subtract the number of cats sold from the initial total.

18 - 10 = 8 cats

Therefore, there are 8 cats remaining in the pet store.
</think>

**Solution:**

To determine how many cats are left in the pet store after the sale, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cats initially present:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total cats} = \text{Siamese cats} + \text{House cats} = 13 + 5 = 18
   \]

2. **Subtract the number of cats sold during the sale:**
   
   \[
   \text{Cats left} = \text{Total cats} - \text{Cats sold} = 18 - 10 = 8
   \]

" Luke was trying to expand his game collection. He bought 2 games from a friend and bought 2 more at a garage sale. If 2 of the games didn't work, how many good games did he end up with? ","<think>
First, I'll calculate the total number of games Luke purchased by adding the games he bought from his friend and those he found at the garage sale.

He bought 2 games from his friend and another 2 at a garage sale, which gives us a total of 4 games.

Out of these 4 games, 2 did not work. To find out how many were good, I'll subtract the number of non-working games from the total number of games purchased.

So, 4 total games minus 2 non-working games equals 2 working games.
</think>

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many **good** games Luke ended up with.

1. **Games Purchased:**
   - **From a friend:** 2 games
   - **At a garage sale:** 2 more games

   **Total games purchased:**  
   \[
   2 + 2 = 4 \text{ games}
   \]

2. **Non-Working Games:**
   - It's given that **2 of the games didn't work**.

3. **Good Games Calculation:**
   
   To find out how many games are **good**, subtract the number of non-working games from the total games purchased:
   
   \[
   4 \text{ (total games)} - 2 \text{ (non-working games)} = 2 \text{ good games}

" The school cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 9 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with? ","<think>
First, I need to determine the total number of apples ordered by calculating the sum of red and green apples.

Next, since only 9 students wanted fruit, I'll subtract this number from the total to find out how many apples were not needed.

Finally, the result will show the number of extra apples that the cafeteria ended up with.
</think>

**Solution:**

We need to determine how many extra apples the cafeteria had after serving only 9 students. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Calculate the total number of apples ordered:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Apples} = \text{Red Apples} + \text{Green Apples} = 42 + 7 = 49
   \]

2. **Determine how many apples were actually served to the students:**
   
   Since only 9 students wanted fruit, we assume each student received one apple.
   
   \[
   \text{Apples Served} = 9
   \]

3. **Find out how many extra apples there are:**
   
   Subtract the number of apples served from the total number of apples ordered.
   
   \[
   \text{Extra Apples} = \text{Total Apples} - \text{Apples Served} = 49 - 9 = 40

Carol picked 29 carrots, and her mother picked 16 carrots. Adding these together gives a total of 45 carrots.

Out of these 45 carrots, only 38 were good. To find out how many bad carrots there are, I subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots.

So, 45 total carrots minus 38 good carrots equals 7 bad carrots.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Total Carrots Picked:**
   
   Carol picked **29** carrots, and her mother picked **16** carrots.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Carrots} = 29 + 16 = 45

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Pastries Left After the Sale**

After the sale:
- **8 pastries were taken back home**

Total pastries left = 8

**Step 3: Calculate the Number of Pastries Sold**

Number of pastries sold = Total pastries baked - Total pastries left

 Henry had 11 dollars. For his birthday he got 18 more dollars but spent 10 on a new game. How much money does he have now? ,"<think>
First, I need to determine how much money Henry has after receiving his birthday gift.

He initially had \$11 and received an additional \$18, so the total amount before any spending is calculated by adding these two amounts together: \$11 + \$18 = \$29.

Next, Henry spent \$10 on a new game. To find out how much money he has left after this purchase, I subtract the cost of the game from the total amount he had: \$29 - \$10 = \$19.

Therefore, after receiving his birthday gift and spending on the game, Henry now has \$19.
</think>

**Solution:**

Henry starts with **\$11**. He receives an additional **\$18** for his birthday. To find out how much money he has after this addition, we add these two amounts together:

\[
\$11 + \$18 = \$29
\]

Next, Henry spends **\$10** on a new game. To determine how much money he has left after the purchase, we subtract the cost of the game from the total amount he had:

\[
\$29 - \$10 = \$19
\]

Therefore, after receiving his birthday gift and spending on the game, Henry now has:

" While on vacation, Gwen took 41 pictures at the zoo and 29 at the museum. If she later deleted 15 of the pictures, how many pictures from her vacation did she still have? ","<think>
First, I need to determine the total number of pictures Gwen took during her vacation. She took 41 pictures at the zoo and 29 pictures at the museum.

Next, I'll add these two quantities together to find the overall total: 41 + 29 = 70 pictures.

After that, Gwen deleted 15 of the pictures she took. To find out how many pictures she still has, I'll subtract the number of deleted pictures from the total: 70 - 15 = 55 pictures.

Therefore, Gwen still has 55 pictures remaining after deleting some.

To determine how many pictures Gwen still has after deleting some, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pictures taken:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total pictures} = \text{Pictures at the zoo} + \text{Pictures at the museum}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total pictures} = 41 + 29 = 70

First, I need to determine the total number of shirts Sam had to wash. He was supposed to wash 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts.

Next, I'll add these two quantities together: 40 + 23 = 63 shirts in total.

Sam only managed to wash 29 of these shirts by the time school started.

To find out how many shirts he did not wash, I'll subtract the number of shirts he washed from the total number of shirts: 63 - 29 = 34 shirts.

Therefore, Sam did not wash 34 shirts.
</think>

**Solution:**

Sam needed to wash a total number of shirts equal to the sum of short sleeve and long sleeve shirts:

\[
\text{Total shirts} = \text{Short sleeve shirts} + \text{Long sleeve shirts} = 40 + 23 = 63
\]

By the time school started, Sam had only washed 29 shirts. To find out how many shirts he did **not** wash:

The store has 12 Siamese cats and 20 House cats. Adding these together gives:

12 + 20 = 32 cats

During the sale, the pet store sold a total of 20 cats. To find out how many cats are left after the sale, I subtract the number of cats sold from the initial total:

32 - 20 = 12 cats

Therefore, there are 12 cats remaining in the pet store.
</think>

To determine how many cats are left in the pet store after the sale, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Cats Initially:**
   
   The store has:

First, I need to determine the total number of apples ordered by calculating the sum of red and green apples.

Next, since only 2 students wanted fruit, I'll subtract this number from the total to find out how many extra apples were obtained.
</think>

**Solution:**

We need to find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with after serving only 2 students. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Calculate the total number of apples ordered:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Apples} = \text{Red Apples} + \text{Green Apples}
   \]
   
   Given:
   
   - Red Apples = 43
   - Green Apples = 32
   
   So,
   
   \[
   \text{Total Apples} = 43 + 32 = 75

2. **Determine the number of apples served to students:**
   
   Since only 2 students wanted fruit, we assume each student received one apple.
   
   \[
   \text{Apples Served} = 2
   \]
   
3. **Calculate the extra apples obtained:**
   
   Subtract the number of apples served from the total number of apples ordered.
   
   \[
   \text{Extra Apples} = \text{Total Apples} - \text{Apples Served}

First, I need to determine the total number of pastries Paige made by adding the cupcakes and cookies together.

She made 36 cupcakes and 9 cookies, so the total is 36 + 9 = 45 pastries.

After the sale, she had 4 pastries left that she took back home. This means she sold all but 4 of her baked goods.

To find out how many pastries she sold, I subtract the number of pastries she took back from the total number she made: 45 - 4 = 41.

 A pet store had 36 siamese cats and 18 house cats. During a sale they sold 26 cats. How many cats do they have left? ,"<think>
First, I need to determine the total number of cats in the pet store initially.

There are 36 Siamese cats and 18 House cats. Adding these together gives:

36 + 18 = 54 cats

During the sale, the pet store sold a total of 26 cats. To find out how many cats remain after the sale, I subtract the number of cats sold from the initial total.

To determine how many cats are left in the pet store after the sale, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cats initially:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total cats} = \text{Siamese cats} + \text{House cats} = 36 + 18 = 54
   \]

2. **Subtract the number of cats sold during the sale:**

First, I need to determine the total number of pastries Amy made by adding the number of cupcakes and cookies.

She made 15 cupcakes and 48 cookies, so the total is 15 + 48 = 63 pastries.

After the sale, she had 12 pastries left that she took back home. This means she sold all but 12 of her baked goods.

To find out how many pastries she sold, I subtract the number of pastries she took back from the total number of pastries made: 63 - 12 = 51.

Therefore, Amy sold a total of 51 pastries.

She made 41 cupcakes and 31 cookies, so the total is 41 + 31 = 72 pastries.

Next, after the sale, she had 32 pastries left that she needed to take back home. This means she sold all but 32 of her baked goods.

To find out how many pastries she sold, I subtract the number of pastries she took back from the total number of pastries made: 72 - 32 = 40.

Therefore, Wendy sold a total of 40 pastries.

" The school cafeteria ordered 25 red apples and 17 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 10 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with? ","<think>
First, I need to determine the total number of apples ordered by calculating the sum of red and green apples.

Next, since only 10 students wanted fruit, I'll subtract this number from the total to find out how many apples were not needed.

Finally, the result will show the number of extra apples that the cafeteria ended up with.
</think>

To determine how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, let's follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of apples ordered:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Apples} = \text{Red Apples} + \text{Green Apples}
   \]
   
   Given:
   
   - Red Apples = 25
   - Green Apples = 17
   
   So,
   
   \[
   \text{Total Apples} = 25 + 17 = 42
   \]

2. **Determine the number of apples needed for the students:**
   
   Since only 10 students wanted fruit, we need to know how many apples are required for these students.
   
   However, the problem doesn't specify how many apples each student needs. Assuming that each student can have one apple (a common assumption in such problems), the number of apples needed is:
   
   \[
   \text{Apples Needed} = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the extra apples:**
   
   Subtract the number of apples needed from the total number of apples ordered to find the extra apples.
   
   \[
   \text{Extra Apples} = \text{Total Apples} - \text{Apples Needed}
   \]
   
   Plugging in the numbers:

" Adam had 33 books. If he sold 11 of them and used the money he earned to buy 23 new books, how many books would Adam have? ","<think>
First, I'll start by noting that Adam initially has 33 books.

He sells 11 of these books, which means he loses 11 books from his collection. Subtracting this amount from the initial total gives us 33 - 11 = 22 books remaining.

Next, Adam uses the money he earned from selling the books to buy new ones. He spends an amount equal to the value of the sold books on purchasing 23 new books. This means his total number of books increases by 23 after this purchase.

Finally, adding the newly purchased books to the remaining collection gives us a total of 22 + 23 = 45 books.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Books:**
   - Adam starts with **33 books**.

2. **Books Sold:**
   - He sells **11 books**.

" Frank made 5 dollars mowing lawns and 58 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 7 dollar a week, how long would the money last him? ","<think>
First, I need to calculate the total amount of money Frank has by adding the money he earned from mowing lawns and the money he spent on weed eating.

Frank earned $5 from mowing lawns and spent $58 on weed eating. So, the total amount of money is $5 + $58 = $63.

Next, I need to determine how long this total amount will last if Frank spends $7 each week.

To find out the number of weeks the money will last, I'll divide the total amount by the weekly spending: $63 ÷ $7 per week = 9 weeks.

Therefore, the money will last Frank for 9 weeks.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Total Amount of Money:**
   
   - **Money earned from mowing lawns:** \$5
   - **Money spent on weed eating:** \$58

To determine the total cost for the group to eat at the restaurant, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Adult meal cost:** \$3
- **Kids' meal cost:** Free (i.e., \$0)
- **Total number of people in the group:** 12
- **Number of children in the group:** 7

**Step 1: Calculate the Number of Adults**

Since there are 12 people in total and 7 of them are children, we can find the number of adults by subtracting the number of children from the total number of people.

\[
\text{Number of adults} = \text{Total people} - \text{Number of children} = 12 - 7 = 5

Next, calculate the cost for the adult meals by multiplying the number of adults (7) by the price per adult meal ($2), which equals $14.

Since kids eat for free, there is no additional cost for their meals.

Finally, add the cost of the adult meals to find the total cost for the group: $14 + $0 = $14.
</think>

To determine the total cost for the group to eat at the restaurant, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Adult meal cost:** \$2
- **Kids' meal cost:** Free (i.e., \$0)
- **Total number of people in the group:** 9
- **Number of children in the group:** 2

**Step 1: Calculate the Number of Adults**

Since there are 9 people in total and 2 are children, we can find the number of adults by subtracting the number of children from the total number of people.

\[
\text{Number of adults} = \text{Total number of people} - \text{Number of children}

**Step 3: Calculate the Total Cost for the Group**

Since kids eat for free, their meals do not contribute to the total cost. Therefore, the total cost for the group is equal to the total cost of adult meals.

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for adults}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$14

 Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? ,"<think>
First, I need to determine how many games Edward has left after selling some.

He initially had 35 games and sold 19 of them. Subtracting the sold games from the initial amount gives:

35 - 19 = 16

Next, I'll figure out how many boxes he needs to pack these remaining 16 games. Each box holds 8 games. To find the number of boxes required, I divide the total number of games by the capacity per box:

16 ÷ 8 = 2

Therefore, Edward will need 2 boxes to store all his remaining games.
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Initial number of games:** 35
- **Number of games sold:** 19
- **Number of games per box:** 8

**Step 1: Calculate the number of games left after selling.**

\[
\text{Games remaining} = \text{Initial games} - \text{Games sold} = 35 - 19 = 16
\]

**Step 2: Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games.**

Each box can hold **8** games.

\[
\text{Number of boxes} = \frac{\text{Games remaining}}{\text{Games per box}} = \frac{16}{8} = 2
\]

**Final Answer:**

Edward needs to use \(\boxed{2}\) boxes.",2

First, I need to determine how much money Frank has left after spending on mower blades.

Frank initially made $19 and spent $11 on mower blades. Subtracting these amounts gives him $8 remaining.

With the remaining $8, he wants to buy games that cost $2 each. Dividing the total amount of money by the cost per game will tell me how many games he can purchase.
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Frank made **\$19** mowing lawns over the summer.
- He spent **\$11** on new mower blades.
- We need to find out how many **\$2 games** he could buy with the remaining money.

**Step 1: Calculate the Remaining Money After Buying Mower Blades**

\[
\text{Remaining Money} = \text{Total Money Made} - \text{Amount Spent on Mower Blades}
\]

\[
\text{Remaining Money} = \$19 - \$11 = \$8
\]

**Step 2: Determine How Many \$2 Games He Can Buy**

Each game costs **\$2**, so we divide the remaining money by the cost per game.

\[
\text{Number of Games} = \frac{\text{Remaining Money}}{\text{Cost per Game}} = \frac{\$8}{\$2} = 4
\]

**Final Answer:**

Frank could buy \(\boxed{4}\) games with the money he had left.",4

" Katie's team won their dodgeball game and scored 12 points total. If Katie scored 4 of the points and everyone else scored 4 points each, how many players were on her team? ","<think>
First, I'll start by understanding the problem. The team scored a total of 12 points in the dodgeball game.

Katie scored 4 points on her own. That means the remaining points must have been scored by the other players on the team.

Since each of the other players scored 4 points, I can set up an equation to represent this situation. Let's let \( x \) be the number of other players on the team. Each of these players contributed 4 points, so together they contributed \( 4x \) points.

The total points scored by the team is the sum of Katie's points and her teammates' points. This gives us the equation:
\[ 4 + 4x = 12 \]

To find the number of other players, I'll solve for \( x \):
\[ 4x = 12 - 4 \]
\[ 4x = 8 \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, there are 2 other players on the team. Including Katie, that makes a total of:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \] players.

Therefore, the team had 3 players in total.
</think>

Let's determine how many players were on Katie's dodgeball team step by step.

**Given:**
- Total points scored by the team: **12 points**
- Katie scored **4 points**.
- Each of the other players scored **4 points each**.

**Step 1: Calculate the points scored by the other players.**

Since Katie scored 4 points, the remaining points must be from her teammates:
\[
\text{Points scored by other players} = \text{Total points} - \text{Katie's points} = 12 - 4 = 8
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of other players.**

Each of the other players scored **4 points**. Let \( x \) be the number of other players:
\[
4x = 8
\]
\[
x = \frac{8}{4} = 2
\]

So, there are **2** other players on the team.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of players on the team.**

Including Katie:
\[
\text{Total players} = \text{Katie} + \text{Other players} = 1 + 2 = 3

Next, I'll figure out how many cages are needed by dividing the remaining number of puppies by the capacity per cage. Each cage holds 9 puppies, so I divide 81 by 9.

Finally, performing the division gives me 9 cages in total.
</think>

**Solution:**

We start with **102 puppies** at the pet store.

1. **Calculate the remaining puppies after selling some:**
   
   \[
   102 \text{ puppies} - 21 \text{ sold} = 81 \text{ puppies}
   \]

2. **Determine how many cages are needed to hold the remaining puppies, with each cage holding 9 puppies:**
   
   \[
   \frac{81 \text{ puppies}}{9 \text{ puppies per cage}} = 9 \text{ cages}
   \]

" Roger had 120 pieces of clothing to wash. He put 48 of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into 9 equal loads. How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads? ","<think>
First, I need to determine how many pieces of clothing are left after Roger uses up 48 pieces for the initial load.

Roger had a total of 120 pieces of clothing and used 48 of them. So, subtracting those gives me 120 minus 48, which equals 72 pieces remaining.

Next, I need to divide these remaining 72 pieces into 9 equal loads. To find out how many pieces go into each small load, I'll divide the total number of remaining pieces by the number of loads: 72 divided by 9.

Calculating that gives me 8 pieces per small load.
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Total pieces of clothing: 120
- Pieces used in the initial load: 48
- Number of remaining pieces to be split into equal loads: ?

**Step 1: Calculate Remaining Pieces**

\[
\text{Remaining pieces} = \text{Total pieces} - \text{Pieces used in initial load}
