" For Halloween Debby and her sister combined the candy they received. Debby had 32 pieces of candy while her sister had 42. If they ate 35 pieces the first night, how many pieces do they have left? ","To determine how many pieces of candy Debby and her sister have left after eating some on Halloween, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of candies initially:**
   - Debby had 32 pieces.
   - Her sister had 42 pieces.

   Adding these together:
   \[
   32 + 42 = 74
   \]

2. **Subtract the number of candies they ate:**
   - They ate a total of 35 pieces on Halloween night.

   Subtracting this from their initial total:
   \[
   74 - 35 = 39
   \]

Therefore, Debby and her sister have \(39\) pieces of candy left.",39

" Luke was trying to expand his game collection. He bought 2 games from a friend and bought 2 more at a garage sale. If 2 of the games didn't work, how many good games did he end up with? ","Luke initially had no information about the quality of the games until he tried them out. From his purchases:

- He got 2 games from a friend.
- He bought 2 more at a garage sale.

This means in total, Luke has 4 games now (2 + 2 = 4).

Out of these 4 games, it is stated that 2 didn't work. Therefore, the number of good games he ended up with would be:

Total games - Non-working games = Good games
4 - 2 = 2

So, Luke ended up with 2 good games.",2
" The school cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 9 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with? ","To determine how many extra fruits the cafeteria ended up with, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of fruits ordered.
2. Determine the number of fruits actually used by the 9 students who wanted fruit.
3. Subtract the number of fruits used from the total number of fruits ordered to find out how many are left over.

Let's start with step 1: The cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples, so the total number of fruits ordered is:
\[ 42 + 7 = 49 \]

Next, for step 2: If only 9 students wanted fruit, they would have used all 9 of these fruits. So, we subtract the number of fruits used from the total number of fruits ordered to find out how many are left over (step 3):
\[ 49 - 9 = 40 \]

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 40 extra fruits.",40
" Lana picked 36 tulips and 37 roses to make flower bouquets. If she only used 70 of the flowers though, how many extra flowers did Lana pick? ","Lana initially picked 36 tulips and 37 roses, which totals:

\[ 73 - 70 = 3 \]

So, Lana had 3 extra flowers that she did not use in making the bouquets.",3
" Carol and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Carol picked 29 and her mother picked 16. If only 38 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have? ","To determine the number of bad carrots, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of carrots picked.
2. Subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots.

First, let's find out the total number of carrots picked by Carol and her mother:
\[
29 \text{ (picked by Carol)} + 16 \text{ (picked by her mother)} = 45 \text{ carrots}
\]

Next, we know that only 38 of these carrots were good. To find the number of bad carrots, we subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots:
\[
45 \text{ (total carrots)} - 38 \text{ (good carrots)} = 7 \text{ bad carrots}
\]

Therefore, the number of bad carrots they had is:

" Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 29 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash? ","To determine how many shirts Ned didn't wash, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of shirts Ned initially needed to wash.
2. Subtract the number of shirts he actually washed from the initial total.

First, let's find out the total number of shirts Ned had to wash:
- He had 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts.
- Therefore, the total number of shirts is \( 9 + 21 = 30 \).

Next, we know that he washed 29 of these shirts by the time school started.

To find out how many shirts he didn't wash, we subtract the number of shirts he washed from the total number of shirts:
- Total shirts: 30
- Shirts washed: 29

So, the number of shirts not washed is \( 30 - 29 = 1 \).

Therefore, Ned did not wash 1 shirt.",1
" Oliver had to wash 39 short sleeve shirts and 47 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 20 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash? ","To determine how many shirts Oliver didn't wash, we need to follow these steps:

- Long sleeve shirts: 47

Total number of shirts = 39 (short sleeve) + 47 (long sleeve) = 86 shirts

Next, we know that Oliver washed 20 shirts by the time school started.

Now, let's find out how many shirts he didn't wash:
- Total shirts needed to be washed: 86
- Shirts actually washed: 20

Number of shirts not washed = Total shirts - Shirts washed = 86 - 20 = 66

 For the school bake sale Wendy made pastries. She baked 4 cupcakes and 29 cookies. After the sale she had 24 to take back home. How many pastries did she sell? ,"To find out how many pastries Wendy sold, we need to determine the total number of pastries she initially baked and then subtract the number of items she took home.

Wendy made:
- 4 cupcakes
- 29 cookies

The total number of pastries (cupcakes + cookies) she initially baked is:

\[ 4 \text{ cupcakes} + 29 \text{ cookies} = 33 \text{ pastries} \]

After the sale, Wendy had 24 items to take back home. These 24 items include both cupcakes and cookies.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the number of cupcakes sold.
- \( K \) as the number of cookies sold.

We know that:

\[ C + K = 24 \]

Since she initially had 4 cupcakes, the number of cupcakes sold is:

\[ C = 4 - (C_{\text{initial}} - C_{\text{sold}}) \]
where \( C_{\text{initial}} \) is the initial number of cupcakes and \( C_{\text{sold}} \) is the number of cupcakes sold.

Given that she had 29 cookies initially, we can find out how many cookies were sold:

\[ K = 29 - (K_{\text{initial}} - K_{\text{sold}}) \]
where \( K_{\text{initial}} \) is the initial number of cookies and \( K_{\text{sold}} \) is the number of cookies sold.

Since she had 4 cupcakes initially, we can calculate:

\[ C = 4 - (C_{\text{initial}} - C_{\text{sold}}) = 4 - (4 - C_{\text{sold}}) = C_{\text{sold}} \]

And since the total number of items taken home is 24, we can write:

\[ C + K = 24 \]
\[ C_{\text{sold}} + K_{\text{sold}} = 24 \]

Given \( C_{\text{initial}} = 4 \) and \( K_{\text{initial}} = 29 \), we can find:

\[ C_{\text{sold}} + K_{\text{sold}} = 24 \]
\[ C_{\text{sold}} + (K_{\text{initial}} - K_{\text{sold}}) = 24 \]

Since \( K_{\text{initial}} = 29 \):

\[ C_{\text{sold}} + (29 - K_{\text{sold}}) = 24 \]
\[ C_{\text{sold}} + 29 - K_{\text{sold}} = 24 \]
\[ C_{\text{sold}} - K_{\text{sold}} = 24 - 29 \]
\[ C_{\text{sold}} - K_{\text{sold}} = -5 \]

Since \( C_{\text{sold}} + K_{\text{sold}} = 24 \):

We can solve these equations simultaneously:

From \( C_{\text{sold}} + K_{\text{sold}} = 24 \) and \( C_{\text{sold}} - K_{\text{sold}} = -5 \), we get:
\[ 2C_{\text{sold}} = 19 \]
\[ C_{\text{sold}} = 9.5 \]

Since the number of pastries sold must be an integer, let's recheck:

If \( C_{\text{sold}} + K_{\text{sold}} = 24 \) and \( C_{\text{sold}} - K_{\text{sold}} = -5 \):

\[ C_{\text{sold}} = 9.5 \] (not possible, as it's not an integer)

Rechecking the problem setup:

If she had initially 33 pastries:
- Sold \( C + K = 24 \)
- Remaining: 24

Thus, Wendy sold:

\[ C_{\text{sold}} = 9 \]
\[ K_{\text{sold}} = 15 \]

So the total number of pastries sold is:

\[ C_{\text{sold}} + K_{\text{sold}} = 9 + 15 = 24 \]

Therefore, Wendy sold \( 24 - 4 = 20 \) pastries. 

Final answer: Wendy sold 20 pastries.",9
" While on vacation, Debby took 24 pictures at the zoo and 12 at the museum. If she later deleted 14 of the pictures, how many pictures from her vacation did she still have? ","Let's break down the problem step by step:

   - At the zoo: 24 pictures
   - At the museum: 12 pictures

   Total pictures taken = 24 (zoo) + 12 (museum) = 36 pictures.

2. Next, we need to account for the number of pictures she deleted:
   - She deleted 14 pictures.

3. To find out how many pictures she still has, we subtract the number of pictures she deleted from the total number of pictures taken:
   - Pictures remaining = Total pictures taken - Pictures deleted
   - Pictures remaining = 36 (total) - 14 (deleted) = 22 pictures.

Therefore, Debby still had 22 pictures from her vacation.",22
" Katie picked 3 tulips and 9 roses to make flower bouquets. If she only used 10 of the flowers though, how many extra flowers did Katie pick? ","Katie initially picked a total of 3 tulips + 9 roses = 12 flowers.

\[ 39 + 38 = 77 \]

So, they picked a total of 77 carrots. 

Next, we know that only 64 of the carrots were good. To find out how many bad carrots there are, we subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots:

Number of bad carrots = Total number of carrots - Number of good carrots

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ 77 - 64 \]

Now, let's perform this subtraction:

\[ 77 - 64 = 13 \]

Therefore, they had 13 bad carrots.",13
" There were 30 girls and 36 boys trying out for the schools basketball team. If only 10 of them got called back, how many students didn't make the cut? ","To determine how many students did not get called back for the school's basketball team, we need to follow these steps:

2. Subtract the number of students who were called back from the total number of students.

First, let's find the total number of students who tried out:
- Number of girls: 30
- Number of boys: 36

Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 30 + 36 = 66 \]

Next, we know that only 10 students were called back. To find out how many did not make the cut, we subtract the number of students who were called back from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of students who didn't make the cut} = \text{Total number of students} - \text{Number of students called back} \]
\[ \text{Number of students who didn't make the cut} = 66 - 10 = 56 \]

Therefore, 56 students did not make the cut for the school's basketball team.",56

 Nancy's old washing machine could only wash 9 pieces of clothing at a time. If she had to wash 19 shirts and 8 sweaters how many loads would she have to do? ,"To determine the number of loads Nancy needs to wash her clothes, we need to consider both the shirts and the sweaters separately.

First, let's calculate the number of loads needed for the shirts:
- She has 19 shirts.
- Her washing machine can handle 9 pieces at a time.

\[
\text{Number of loads for shirts} = \left\lceil \frac{19}{9} \right\rceil
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\frac{19}{9} \approx 2.11
\]

Since she can't do a fraction of a load, we round up to the next whole number:

\[
\left\lceil 2.11 \right\rceil = 3
\]

So, Nancy needs 3 loads for the shirts.

Next, let's calculate the number of loads needed for the sweaters:
- She has 8 sweaters.
- Her washing machine can handle 9 pieces at a time.

\[
\text{Number of loads for sweaters} = \left\lceil \frac{8}{9} \right\rceil
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\frac{8}{9} \approx 0.89
\]

Since she can't do a fraction of a load, we round up to the next whole number:

\[
\left\lceil 0.89 \right\rceil = 1
\]

So, Nancy needs 1 load for the sweaters.

Finally, adding the loads together:

\[
3 \text{ (for shirts)} + 1 \text{ (for sweaters)} = 4
\]

Therefore, Nancy would have to do 4 loads in total.",3

","To determine the number of players on Paige's team, we need to account for both Paige's score and the scores of the other players.

Given:
- Total points scored by the team: 41
- Points scored by Paige: 11
- Points scored by each of the other players: 6

Let \( n \) be the number of other players on the team. The total points scored by these \( n \) players would then be \( 6n \).

The equation representing the total points is:
\[ 11 + 6n = 41 \]

To find \( n \), we first subtract Paige's score from the total points:
\[ 6n = 41 - 11 \]
\[ 6n = 30 \]

Given:
- Total points scored by the team: 39 points
- Points scored by Emily: 23 points
- Each of the other players scored 2 points

First, let's calculate the total points scored by the other players. Since Emily scored 23 points, we subtract her score from the total:

The company invited 47 people in total, but 7 didn't show up. Therefore, the number of attendees is:
\[ 47 - 7 = 40 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many tables are required if each table can hold 5 people. We do this by dividing the total number of attendees by the capacity of each table:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

Since the division results in a whole number (8), no additional table is needed for any leftover individuals.

Therefore, they need exactly 8 tables to seat all the attendees.",8
" A waiter had 44 customers in his section. If 12 of them left and the rest of his tables had 8 people at each table, how many tables did he have? ","To determine the number of tables the waiter has, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining customers after some left:**
   The initial number of customers was 44. If 12 customers left, then:
   \[
   44 - 12 = 32
   \]
   So, there are 32 customers remaining.

2. **Determine how many tables and the number of people per table:**
   The problem states that these remaining customers are seated at tables with 8 people each. Let \( t \) be the number of tables. Then:
   \[
   8t = 32
   \]

3. **Solve for \( t \):**
   To find \( t \), divide both sides of the equation by 8:
   \[
   t = \frac{32}{8} = 4
   \]

Therefore, the waiter has 4 tables.",4

" Katie's team won their dodgeball game and scored 12 points total. If Katie scored 4 of the points and everyone else scored 4 points each, how many players were on her team? ","To determine the number of players on Katie's team, we need to account for both Katie's score and the scores of the other players.

Given:
- Total points scored by the team: 12 points.
- Points scored by Katie: 4 points.
- Each of the other players (excluding Katie) scored 4 points each.

Let \( n \) be the number of players on the team excluding Katie. Since each of these \( n \) players scored 4 points, their total score can be calculated as:
\[ 4n \]

The sum of Katie's score and the scores of her teammates should equal the total points scored by the team:
\[ 4 + 4n = 12 \]

To find \( n \), we solve the equation:
\[ 4 + 4n = 12 \]
Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ 4n = 8 \]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ n = 2 \]

Thus, there are 2 players on Katie's team excluding her. Including Katie herself, the total number of players is:

2. Divide this number by the number of groups.

First, let's find out how many students were picked for the teams. We know there are 58 students trying out and 10 didn't get picked. So, we subtract the 10 from the total:

\[ 58 - 10 = 48 \]

So, 48 students got picked for the teams.

Next, these 48 students were divided into 8 groups. To find out how many students are in each group, we divide 48 by 8:

\[ 48 \div 8 = 6 \]

Therefore, there would be 6 students in each group.",6
" Paige picked 53 flowers for her friend’s wedding. She was making bouquets with 7 flowers in each one. If 18 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make? ","To determine how many bouquets Paige can still make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of flowers available after accounting for the wilted ones.
2. Determine how many bouquets can be made with the remaining flowers.

First, Paige originally picked 53 flowers. Since 18 of them wilted, the number of flowers she has left is:
\[ 53 - 18 = 35 \]

Next, we need to find out how many bouquets she can make with these 35 flowers. Each bouquet requires 7 flowers. Therefore, the number of bouquets she can make is given by dividing the remaining flowers by the number of flowers per bouquet:
\[ 35 \div 7 = 5 \]

So, Paige can still make \(\boxed{5}\) bouquets.",5
" A waiter had 22 customers in his section. If 14 of them left and the rest of his tables had 4 people at each table, how many tables did he have? ","To determine the number of tables the waiter has, we can follow these steps:

Therefore, they need exactly 2 tables to seat all the attendees.",2
" Bianca's team won their dodgeball game and scored 75 points total. If Bianca scored 45 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team? ","To determine the number of players on Bianca's team, we need to account for both Bianca's score and the scores of the other players.

Given:
- Total points scored by the team: 75 points
- Points scored by Bianca: 45 points
- Points scored by each of the other players: 6 points

First, subtract Bianca's points from the total to find out how many points were scored by the other players:

\[ \text{Points scored by other players} = \text{Total points} - \text{Bianca's points} \]
\[ \text{Points scored by other players} = 75 - 45 = 30 \]

Next, we know that each of the other players scored 6 points. Let \( n \) be the number of other players on Bianca's team. Therefore:

\[ \text{Total points scored by other players} = n \times 6 \]
\[ 30 = n \times 6 \]

Solving for \( n \):

\[ n = \frac{30}{6} = 5 \]

So, there are 5 other players on Bianca's team. Including Bianca herself:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = n + 1 \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 5 + 1 = 6 \]

Therefore, the total number of players on Bianca's team is \( 6 \).",5
